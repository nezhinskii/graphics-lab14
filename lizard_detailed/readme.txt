Repainted Reptile Tournament MKX
-syzoth the saurian gets a repaint here with new details on his tournament gear and a new scaly pattern on his skin, plus an optional mask. although this is just a simple visual update to reptile, he now fits in better among the mk revised set! have fun with the renders if you give his redesign a try

-many thanks for the original model sources: 
reptile: https://www.deviantart.com/undeadmentor/art/MKX-Raiden-Tournament-542434030

detailed info:
-all textures repainted - detailed scaly/leathery skin tone added to reptile's head, arms, and body; acidic bubbling on his armor, rough canvas cloth, well-worn leather and metal. surface color depth and patterns upgraded across outfit
-mask optional and also repainted in the same style
-his eyes look more focused now (default pose slightly adjusted). teeth look a bit more clean too 
-posing structure is the same otherwise, matching the mkx default standard
-preview pose included as reptilepreview.pose
-that's all!

note: justthehead.mesh not included, you can't do much with a reptile head and human outfit body. if you already know how to dress up the reptile model in new clothes, you don't need the justthehead file
